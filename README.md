# Better-Me

This app was created for the VandyHacks V competition, which is a 36-hour competition. 

It was also the first android app that we have worked on. 

Better Me is an app created with self-improvement in mind. It works by presenting the user with a daily task, such as read a book or talk to a stranger.
The user can choose to complete the task, but there is no real incentive other than self-improvement. 

Since this was the first android application that we built, there was more learning than actual coding. During the competition we were able to:
- Learn how android UI works and get a simple one set up
- Connect our application to Firebase
- Created a simple way of managing our data using Firebase
- Read and write to the database
- Load all data and display information to the user
- Finish the core functionality 

We were not able to finish:
- Accurate timing of the tasks 
- Using a character to represent the users' task completion. As the user did more and more tasks, the character would become happier, and if tasks were not completed, the character would become sadder. 
- Getting the correct swipe directions 
- Good architecture use

Although this application has a lot of flaws, it is an important app, as it is my first. Comparing this application to more recent ones shows improvement in almost all aspects of development.
